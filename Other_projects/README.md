## Other Projects
### 01 AVI Labeler
*January 2021*  
Used ImageJ's Java-like programming language to set up a video annotation workflow. This enabled a more robust team 
collaboration and feedback system than was possible with the many annotation software vendors I met with.

### 02 Cardiac Cath Report Info
*December 2019*  
Used regex within Python to obtain infromation from free-text cardiac catheterization procedure reports.

### 03 FDA 510k Scraping
*December 2023*  
Performed web scraping of FDA 510k submissions to identify those pertaining to cardiology AI.

### 04 Excel EEG Graphs
*June 2005*  
Joined a neuroscience lab in 2005 that analyzed and visualized EEG data in Excel. Learned Excel VBA from a book and 
scripted a macro to automate these steps, saving several hours of work per week.

### 05 Healthcare AI Assessment slide deck
*October 2023*  
Created slide deck for a nontechnical audience assessing AI-based healthcare tools. I plan to convert this to a series 
of Medium posts to help improve healthcare AI literacy.
